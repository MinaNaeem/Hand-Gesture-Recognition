<h1 align="center" id="title">Handstalk: A Deep Learning-Powered ASL Translator</h1>

<p id="description">The Handstalk project seeks to revolutionize communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community by leveraging the power of deep learning. Our goal is to create a robust and accurate model that can recognize and translate American Sign Language (ASL) gestures into text. By focusing on the ASL alphabet (A-Z) we aim to provide a valuable tool for enhancing communication accessibility.</p>

  
  
<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   Text-based translation: Recognized gestures are translated into corresponding text for easy understanding.
*   Deep learning architecture: We employ a state-of-the-art deep learning model YOLOv8 to ensure high-performance gesture detection.
*   User-friendly interface: The project will feature an intuitive interface for seamless interaction. Technical Approach
